The Western Roman Empire is long gone. The Lombards never succeeded in taking Rome, but the once glorious city suffered a lot from the wars against its barbarian neighbor. The cities in the south took their independence and many of them are now heavily influenced by the Eastern Roman Empire(Eastern Rome invaded the area at one point).

Rome switched from a republic to tyranny and from tyranny to republic multiple times without great success. The last years saw another war between Rome and the Lombards. Rome managed to take back its missing part of Tuscany but at what cost ?
The king is hated by many, their neighbors dislike them, their province spreads the word of secession,  the coffers are empty, and there are no men left for the Roman fields or armies.
Rome is in a dire situation



Lombards:


They lost the duchy of Padova and Aquileia after a catastrophic war against Narbonnensis where they lost Nizza . These duchies took this opportunity to break free.

An ambitious king rose some year ago, he managed to submit Padova and Aquileia and launch an attack on Rome. His armies were stopped at Veii, and he lost several battle afterwards. He finally lost the war and his territories in Tuscany with it. Padova(who also took some territories) and Aquileia took back their independence, this time joined by Piedmont. The once glorious Lombard Kingdom is now reduce to the duchy of Pavia.
