Lore :
After the fall of  the Western Roman Empire, the provinces of Africa and Mauretania took their independence like many other provinces.

They went at war against various berber tribes to expand their territories and their hold on the trans-saharan trade. These wars created another, the Jarawa led by Kuhina united several tribes and marched on Africa's territory (in reality Kuhina was a berber queen who fought the Arabs). They won several battle and the province of Africa collapsed while Mauretania lost most of its eastern provinces.

The occupation was gentle and most of the Roman cities on the coast kept a lot of autonomy. This pax-Numidia as it was called by the Romans benefited a lot to the cities on the coast of Africa and they soon became the most prosperous cities in the Mediterranean. They also grew more and more independent from the Jarawa.

In 1444, the Jarawa are crippled by a civil war and the cities of Africa took this opportunity to cut all their bonds with them.
