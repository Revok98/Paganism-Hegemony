Note : only important events are recorded here so we may jump from the first Burgondo-Roman war to the fourth Burgondo-Roman war as the others saw little changes in the balance of power of the region

688-689 : Invasion of Northern Gallia by Burgonds and Franks (the invasion comes later than in History, Rome more or less managed to push back the Huns and the Franks were named governor of the province of Belgica
Even if it prevents other Germanic Invasions, it eventually backfired when an Emperor mistreated the Franks who then began to invade other territories in Gaul.
Rome weakened by three centuries of agony could just watch its empire crumble as barbarians invade Gallia/Italia/Illyria/Britannia and rich provinces such as Hispania or Africa secede from the Empire.
The Franks had everything north of the Loire, the Burgonds had Bourgogne/Lorraine and parts of Champagne and the former roman provinces of Lugdunensis/Aquitania and Narbonensis had the rest
It is also known as the first Franko-Roman war and the first Burgondo-Roman War

685-715 : Celtic migrations in Brittany

743-751: First Franko-Burgond war
Saw the crushing defeat of the Burgond to the Franks who took the rest of Champagne
Following this defeat the weakened Burgond were attacked by the Suebian (who hold most of Switzerland) but manage to repel them

756-1092: Conquest of Germany by the franks
This isn't the subject of this part but the conquest of Germany occured during this period.

Which saw the rise of Gundobad as a proeminant Burgond king and general
He managed to repel numerous Frankish invasion and even counter attacked

Which saw the fall of Lugdunum and Lugdunensis
The second and third war were minor wars which saw minor border changes between the two power

1253: West and East Francia split (the split is quite recent compared with History. That explains why they still share the same culture group)

1420: The Eternal Alliance for Gallia between Narbonensis and Aquitania

1430-1436: seventh Burgondo-Roman war

Draft (actually canon but need to be more organized):

 and annex territories south of the Loire
