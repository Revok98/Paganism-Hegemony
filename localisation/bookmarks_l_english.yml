 ITALIA_NAME:0 "Roman Resurgence"
 ITALIA_DESC:0 "Rome almost lost everything : three quarter of the western empire seceded while the other part was overrun by barbarians. Rome is no longer at the head of the Empire but a mere kingdom trying to take back its long lost glory. The city was even threatened by the Lombards some decades ago. They were stopped at the battle of Veii but this victory was costly for Rome. Even tough it manages to take back some lost land in Tuscany, Rome is weak. It is indebted and its army is depleted. But perhaps a good ruler may be able to stabilize Rome and giving it back its old Empire, perhaps ...."
 WRE_NAME:0 "A decentralized Empire"

 GERMANY_NAME:0 "European Khanate"
 GERMANY_DESC:0 "The Mongols were stopped in Sorbia by a coalition of Slavs, Franks and Saxons. However, the cost was heavy for East Francia with the death of its king on the battlefield without any heir. The Saxons used this weakness to invade the north of East Francia and the Kingdom was soon divided between independant duchy. The Mongols were in no better state. They also lost their Khan in the battle and a similar division occured between Subutai Khante in Pannonia and Orda Khanate in Poland. The Mongols are weakened but they are far from destroyed and they still represent a threat for Europe. If the others let them recover from their wounds it may sound the death knell for central Europe."

Africa didn't survived the war but the Jarawas were merciful. Most of the cities were spared and became tributaries of the Jarawas. This Pax-Numidia benefited these cities a lot and they became prosper, so prosper that when the Jarawas were lost in a civil war, they stopped send tributes. But the civil war won't be eternal and if the Jarawas come out strong from this trial they may be able to submit the African city states again."

Three princes were better than the others at this game : the princes of Kiev, Novgorod and Rostov managed to secure significant territories and influence. The tensions between them are raising and war seems inevitable. But they are not the only players in the region, the Cumans managed to secure a part of their old Empire and have interests in the Russian affairs. The Ugric tribes in the north, recently feudalized, will try to take their former territories. The war for Russia has only begun."
