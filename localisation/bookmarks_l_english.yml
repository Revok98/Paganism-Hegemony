Rome was even threatened by the Lombards who were stopped at the battle of Veii. The emperor was overthrown and a republic instaured. Now back with more political stability, Rome started to conquer again with the conquest of Ravenna some years earlier. And It may be a good timing since the Lombards are in the middle of a crisis which may be fatal.Meanwhile the ex-roman province of Africa renamed Carthage lurks in the shadows ready to expand themselves more in Italy."
 WRE_NAME:0 "A decentralized Empire"

However, the cost was heavy for East Francia with the death of its king on the battlefield without any heir. The Saxons used this weakness to invade the north of East Francia and the Kingdom was soon divided between independant duchy. The Mongols were in no better state. They also lost their Khan in the battle and a similar division occured between Subutai Khante in Pannonia and Orda Khanate in Poland. The Mongols are weakened but they are from destroyed and they still represent a threat for Europe. If the others let them recover from their wounds it may sound the death knell for central Europe."
