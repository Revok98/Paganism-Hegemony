The lore :
With a still mostly Balkanized Scandinavia, the local kingdoms fight for hegemony over the amber trade and the baltic sea. The Norse also embarked on expeditions to Britannia, the other side of the Baltic and even the Slavic steppes. This left them weaken and they couldn't handle the great Sapmi migration led by their charismatic king Ammol. Sweden which managed to unite the Swedes lots several battles against the Sapmi and their kingdom fell into disarray. The crown now only hold the capital of Stockholm which is threatened by the nearby Sapmi.
