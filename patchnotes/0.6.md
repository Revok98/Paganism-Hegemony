**Imperial Incidents**

*Egyptian Shadow Kingdom*
-Works more like the old vanilla Shadow Kingdom than the new one
-Starts in 1446 and ends in 1456
-You should take all of Egypt back into the empire
-The incident start the old event chains I have made before (the ones in which you can declare war on upper Egypt)
-If you win the war against Upper Egypt, you can now balkanized it into the Empire (like Burgundy in vanilla)


*Slavic Uprisings*
-Starts in 1508
-3 choices:
  ~Allow the Slavs to rule themselves : they will most likely convert themselves to the Slavic religion (or illyrian or Tengri for those who have provinces of these religions).
  Those who doesn't convert will suffer a heavy unrest malus as well as rebel spawning
  ~Doesn't allow them to rule : Same as above except to things : If they convert, they declare war on the Emperor and the ai is a bit less likely to convert (approximatively 1/10 instead of 1/100). If the Emperor wins the war they shall reconvert to Theoi and the Emperor gain Imperial Authority. If he loses, he will lose imperial Authority and the Slavs will remain Slavic.
  ~Doesn't allow them to rule and help the greek elites to remain in place: Same as the second one but the malus of unrest in combined with a mercenary reduce cost and maintenance to represent imperial helps. The ai is also less likely to convert (1/2)

*Trade competitors*
-Start after 1600 if Genoa/English Channel/Sevilla/Tunis is richer than Constantinople trade node
-3 choices :
  ~Do nothing
  ~Build the canal of Clymsa (Suez) in exchange for money from all the members (the emperor will pay more). When finished it will give trade power in Hormuz and Gujarat to the emperor
  ~Conquer its way to India; The Emperor will have to conquer at least one province in Basra/Mogostan/Sindh/Gujarat. When the war against their owners is won, it will release a new country (cf others in new countries) which will be set in in the empire and give you trade power in the node.

**Persia** (Thanks Walthorn)

*Satrapian Wars event chain*
This event chain will last from 1444 to 1454 and shows the difficulty of Persia to deal with its powerful satrapies. Each satrapies will asked something from Persia, and the Persian player will have to make difficult choices to keep its empire alive.
There is smore than 3000 lines of code for these events so I won't go in details for them (Moreover since I haven't write them, I will certainly forgot something) but to summarize:
For 10 years you will have to keep the balance between your country and the loyalty of your satrapies. There are new variables will represent the loyalty of each of your satrapies. At 5 they will be loyal and will join your side against Abarshar if the civil war occurs. You can gain loyalty with the different events that will occurs.

(Walthorn if you want to write anything/rewrite what I have done here you can)

*New governments and type of vassal*
There are new governments :
-Satrapdom : +1 monthly admin power and +10% burgher loyalty equilibrum, the government type for the satraps
-Satrap supremacy: the starting government of Persia, gives diplomatic relations and income from vassal but also makr them less loyal (-40%)
-Satrap cooperation: The government for a Persian empire which succeeded in taming its satrapies. Same bonus than Satrap supremacy without the malus
-Satrapy system : the final government of Persia. Gives autonomy reduction and governing capacity.

-Satrapdom are also a new kind of vassal which can't declare war on their master (to prevent the civil war to occurred before 1454)
