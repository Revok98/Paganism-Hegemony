**Africa and Mauretania** :
*Lore*
After the fall of  the Western Roman Empire, the provinces of Africa and Mauretania took their independence like many other provinces.

They went at war against various berber tribes to expand their territories and their hold on the trans-saharan trade. These wars created another, the Jarawa led by Kuhina united several tribes and marched on Africa's territory (in reality Kuhina was a berber queen who fought the Arabs). They won several battle and the province of Africa collapsed while Mauretania lost most of its eastern provinces.

The occupation was gentle and most of the Roman cities on the coast kept a lot of autonomy. This pax-Numidia as it was called by the Romans benefited a lot to the cities on the coast of Africa and they soon became the most prosperous cities in the Mediterranean. They also grew more and more independent from the Jarawa.

In 1444, the Jarawa are crippled by a civil war and the cities of Africa took this opportunity to cut all their bonds with them.

**Italy**:
*Lore*
The Western Roman Empire is long gone. The Lombards never succeeded in taking Rome, but the once glorious city suffered a lot from the wars against its barbarian neighbor. The cities in the south took their independence and many of them are now heavily influenced by the Eastern Roman Empire(Eastern Rome invaded the area at one point).

Rome switched from a republic to tyranny and from tyranny to republic multiple times without great success. The last years saw another war between Rome and the Lombards. Rome managed to take back its missing part of Tuscany but at what cost ?
The king is hated by many, their neighbors dislike them, their province spreads the word of secession,  the coffers are empty, and there are no men left for the Roman fields or armies.
